# Decypher Beginner

Welcome to the Decypher Beginner project! This project is designed to help beginners understand and implement basic cryptographic techniques, with a particular focus on Caesar's Cipher.

## What is Caesar's Cipher?

Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.
